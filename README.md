# Numpy-Assignments

Theoretical Questions:

1. Explain the purpose and advantages of NumPy in scientific computing and data analysis. How does it enhance Python's capabilities for numerical operations?
2. Compare and contrast np.mean() and np.average() functions in NumPy. When would you use one over the other?
3. Describe the methods for reversing a NumPy array along different axes. Provide examples for 1D and 2D arrays.
4. How can you determine the data type of elements in a NumPy array? Discuss the importance of data types in memory management and performance.
5. Define ndarrays in NumPy and explain their key features. How do they differ from standard Python lists?
6. Analyze the performance benefits of NumPy arrays over Python lists for large-scale numerical operations.
7. Compare vstack() and hstack() functions in NumPy. Provide examples demonstrating their usage and output.
8. Explain the differences between fliplr() and flipud() methods in NumPy, including their effects on various array dimensions.
9. Discuss the functionality of the array_split() method in NumPy. How does it handle uneven splits?
10. Explain the concepts of vectorization and broadcasting in NumPy. How do they contribute to efficient array operations?

Practical Questions:

1. Create a 3x3 NumPy array with random integers between 1 and 100. Then, interchange its rows and columns.
2. Generate a 1D NumPy array with 10 elements. Reshape it into a 2x5 array, then into a 5x2 array.
3. Create a 4x4 NumPy array with random float values. Add a border of zeros around it, resulting in a 6x6 array.
4. Using NumPy, create an array of integers from 10 to 60 with a step of 5.
5. Create a NumPy array of strings ['python', 'numpy', 'pandas']. Apply different case transformations (uppercase, lowercase, title case, etc.) to each element.
6. Generate a NumPy array of words. Insert a space between each character of every word in the array.
7. Create two 2D NumPy arrays and perform element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
8. Use NumPy to create a 5x5 identity matrix, then extract its diagonal elements.
9. Generate a NumPy array of 100 random integers between 0 and 1000. Find and display all prime numbers in this array.
10. Create a NumPy array representing daily temperatures for a month. Calculate and display the weekly averages.
